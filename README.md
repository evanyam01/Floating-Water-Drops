My physics professor (the goat) Professor Coates, proposed a project that we can do instead of the intended boring preplanned labs. The task was to use various devices such as a water solenoid and raspberry pi to align the frequency of the strobe of an led to the frequency that a solenoid could quickly produce water drops. After many nights burning up mosfets and re-compiling code, we were finally able to create the effect that the water drops were floating.
